You can download the dataset from this website : http://mrl.cs.vsb.cz/eyedataset
Download the dataset and first run the "Data-preparation.ipynb" file to separate the datas into open eyes and closed eyes
Then create a folder named Prepared data. Inside that folder, create two folders named test and train.
Copy the separated datas (open eyes and closed eyes folders) and paste it inside both test and train folders.
Then run the "training.py" file
Finally run "drowsiness detection.py" file to see the awesome output.
